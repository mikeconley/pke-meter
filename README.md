# PKE Meter (a.k.a. CPOW Geiger Counter)
Detects unsafe or unexpected CPOW usage, and plays a small "click" through the sound
card, not unlike a Geiger Counter.

This is really only useful if running with [Electrolysis](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis) enabled.

# Why "PKE Meter"?
The PKE Meter (or "Psychokinetic Energy Meter") was used by Dr. Egon Spengler to detect
paranormal activity and entities in the Ghostbuster films.

This add-on follows the long Mozilla tradition of naming various projects after bits of
the Ghostbusters universe.
